# Motion Canvas Narrator Example Project

This is an example project demonstrating the use of the `motion-canvas-narrator` package with Motion Canvas which is available [here](https://github.com/prathje/motion-canvas-narrator).  
You should be able to use it right out of the box. However, if you will need to add your own ElevenLabs API key to `src/scenes/example.tsx`.
