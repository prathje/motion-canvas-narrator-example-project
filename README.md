## How to Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
The project should then be accessible at `http://localhost:9000`.

This is an example project demonstrating the use of the `motion-canvas-narrator` package with Motion Canvas.
You should be able to use it right out of the box. However, if you will need to add your own ElevenLabs API key to `src/scenes/example.tsx`.

Note: This project is based on v3.18.0-alpha.0 but relies on a [fork](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas/pull/1205) to enable consistent exports.
